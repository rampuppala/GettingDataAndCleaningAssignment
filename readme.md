### Getting started

  - Step 1 : Create project Directory
  - Step 2 : Download the project file [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and the [run_analysis.R] into newly created project directory from step 1
  - Step 3 : Create folder `UCI HAR Dataset` in project directory 
  - Step 4 : Download [experiment data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)  and extract it into newly created directory `UCI HAR Dataset`.
  - Step 5 :   Run the `run_analysis.R` script. The new `tidy_data.txt` will be created in project home directory.
  

#### Note :   Reference [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script to get a general understanding of this project.
